# Retrieve-and-manage-data-from-an-SCCM-database
This PowerShell script is designed to connect to an SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) server to query specific computer system information from its database. It retrieves data such as computer name, total RAM, computer model, operating system, and OS version. After extracting this information, the script formats it into a readable table, and then exports this formatted data to a text file. It includes error handling to manage connection issues and ensure the database connection is properly closed after the data retrieval process is complete.
